\title{Australian Bushfire Risk Data}
\format{
A data frame with 355 rows and 6 variables:
\describe{
  \item{year}{Numeric. Year of observation (1950-2020)}
  \item{region}{Character. Australian region name. One of: "Southeast Australia",
    "Eastern Australia", "Southern Australia", "Northern Australia",
    "Western Australia"}
  \item{ffdi_mean}{Numeric. Mean Forest Fire Danger Index for the year.
    Higher values indicate more dangerous fire conditions}
  \item{extreme_days}{Numeric. Number of days with extreme fire danger (FFDI > 50)}
  \item{area_burned_1000ha}{Numeric. Total area burned in thousands of hectares}
  \item{attribution_confidence}{Numeric. Percentage confidence that observed
    trends are attributable to anthropogenic climate change (range: 75-95)}
}

\description{
A dataset containing annual bushfire risk metrics for Australian regions
from 1950 to 2020. Data is based on attribution studies showing how
anthropogenic climate change has increased fire danger.
}
\details{
The Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) is calculated from temperature, humidity,
wind speed, and drought conditions. Values above 50 indicate "extreme" fire danger.

This dataset shows that:
\itemize{
  \item Southeast Australia has experienced the strongest increase in fire risk
  \item Human-caused climate change has made extreme fire weather more common
  \item Fire danger has increased most rapidly since 1980
  \item The 2019-2020 "Black Summer" saw unprecedented fire activity
